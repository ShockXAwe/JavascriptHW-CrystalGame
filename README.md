# JavascriptHW-CrystalGame

This game was one of my assignments from school.

The objective of this game is to match your score with the goal score given. Each crystal has a random value and stays that value until the game is over. You click on the crystal and add up your score, if your score exceeds the goal you lose the game, if it meets the goal you win! Each win and loss will be recorded and counted on the are within the DOM.

Once the game is won or lost each crysyal will change value and a new goal score will be given along with your score resetting to zero.
